# image-HUE-analysis
A Jupyter project that analyzes crop images by detecting green hues and separating them into levels. This helps visualize crop status and detect potential stress areas. The current version is tuned for green hues under direct sunlight, but future improvements could normalize shadows and lighting variations.
